# Austin Ham Radio Nets

This page constitutes a probably-non-exhaustive listing of ham radio nets in the
Austin, TX metro area. See the [repeaters list](repeaters.md) for more
information about the repeaters referenced here.

This page is broken into multiple sections: There is a schedule table for
at-a-glance information about nets and when they occur. Below that, there is a
section for "as-needed" net procedures (for things like Skywarn and ARES). The
last sections has blurbs about most of the scheduled nets with more information
about what to expect from them.

Note that some nets listed here might be held on repeater networks with Austin
links, not specific to Austin.

All times are Central.
