# Ham Radio (AI5A)

I operate out of Austin, TX, typically on 40m up through 33cm (excluding 1.25m,
currently). You can sometimes find me on local repeaters if you're in the area
(usually on "The OAK" 147.320, on the K5TRA 900MHz system, or on the KA5D
system) or on HF (lately, FT8 and often on 6m when it is open).


## The AI5A Antenna Farm

Due to living in an apartment, I operate with some compromise
antennas. The good news is that I have two balconies to work with and that
apartment management seems to not be super scared of antennas. As a result, I
don't have to be super stealth. However, I also try to keep things toned down so
as not to poke the bear.

I have Comet CTC-50 window feed-thru jumpers to run
connections in through the sliding balcony doors. Switching antennas for HF is
currently a manual process - going out on the balcony and connecting
the antenna for the band I want to operate. I plan to fix this in the
future with a remote antenna switch, but it's not a huge priority, just a minor
inconvenience. Currently, most of HF (10-30m) is provided by one antenna,
anyway. Switching is only required when going from 40m, 10-30m, and 6m.

My view of the world mostly runs NE and SW. NW is blocked by an adjacent
apartment building directly across from my back balcony. A view of the SE is
accessible from the front balcony, though I don't currently take advantage of
it. In the future, I might put something directional there to target SA
contacts, if I can find something small enough.

Currently, all of my HF antennas are on the back balcony, and most of my VHF/UHF
antennas are on the front balcony. The exceptions are a KP-20 900MHz antenna
that is hidden in the closet of my back balcony (it's an 8ft tall antenna!), and
a 2m j-pole which I can switch to in order to hear some of the locals on simplex
night better.

My current setup is as follows (from low to high frequency):

* **40m** - For 40m, I have a custom-made dipole that is zip-tied to
  the railing posts of my balcony, in a square-wave pattern. That is,
  the antenna goes up one post, over, down the next, over, up the
  next, etc. This covers most of the length of the antenna, but there
  is some wire left on both sides, which currently just rests on the
  balcony floor. The antenna terminates to a homebrew 1:1 balun. This
  setup works "okay" and the SWR is locked down, but the antenna is
  unfortunately not very efficient. It can get me on 40m in a pinch,
  but I think the square-wave pattern limits the effectiveness of the
  antenna.

* **10m - 30m** - For the higher HF bands up through 10m, I use an
  MFJ-1782 magnetic loop, positioned horizontally. Although magnetic loops are
  typically considered compromise antennas, I've actually been very happy with
  the results. I obtained WAS and CQ WPX with the antenna and work DX regularly
  on FT8 with no issues. The Comet jumper mentioned above functions just fine
  with the loop controller. The antenna is mounted on a Wiregard DS-2000 22"
  mast, which itself is mounted to the top of my balcony railing with two large
  C-clamps, to avoid drilling into the wood of the balcony. (The antenna is also
  rope-tied to the balcony as a safe-guard in case the C-clamps fail for any
  reason).

* **6m (dipole)** - I have two antennas for 6m, the first is a small
  wire dipole which rests along the top of my balcony railing and
  terminates to a balun.

* **6m (stressed moxon)** The second, and newer, antenna I have for 6m
  is a stressed moxon (SM-50) from PAR Electronics. This is not currently in use
  yet, but will eventually be on the back balcony and be stationary, pointed
  toward the NE.

* **2m/70cm (vertical)** - This is provided by a Diamond X30A vertical
  which lives on the front balcony, currently by itself.

* **2m (j-pole)** I also have a DPD Productions 2 meter blade antenna which
  lives on the back balcony. I can switch between the Diamond and this one,
  depending on need. Usually the j-pole on the back balcony works better for
  hearing some of the locals on the Tuesday night simplex net.

* **2m (horizontal)** - Additionally, I have a GRA-YG1443 2m/70cm
  square dipole, but it is not currently in use.

* **33cm (whip)** - For 900MHz, I have a small Laird QW8963 whip atop a Laird
  MBC800 counterpoise base. It is currently on the back balcony and on the same
  mast as the HF magnetic loop. This whip is being replaced by:

* **33cm (vertical)** - I also now have a Comet KP-20 vertical. Because the
  antenna is so tall (8ft), it lives its life hidden away in the closet on my
  back balcony. Using this, I can often be found on the 927-Tech system.

* **Desk Shelving** - All radio gear is housed on a
  [PENGKE shelf unit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V85QS4T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  bought on Amazon. The shelf assembles into two pieces which fit together and
  slide to change the width of two of the shelves. On the top shelf is my audio
  mixer (discussed below). Below that are my VHF/UHF and 900MHz radios. Below
  that (on the desk, but still enclosed within the shelf unit) is a Daiwa
  power/SWR meter. To the right is a shelf which houses the ANC-4 noise
  canceller (discussed below) and MFJ loop controller. And finally, below that
  is the IC-7300. Wiring is currently a bit of a work in progress, but a picture
  of the shelf unit will be posted in the near future.

* **Audio** - All radios along with computer audio go through a Soundcraft Ui12
  digital audio mixer. Primary output is headphones currently. Levels can be
  controlled via any device on the network (i.e., tablet, phone, or desktop).

* **Cables** - All patch cables (radio-meter, meter-controller) are RG400. They
  are wrapped around #31 ferrite cores as are most of the other cables and
  wires that are anywhere near the radios. Coax runs throughout the apartment
  are mostly RG-8X, with a planned upgrade to LMR-400 spec for 900MHz. They are
  hidden with cable covers such as
  [Legrand Wiremold covers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015EDVVU/).

* **Power** - Power is provided by an Astron RS-35A and is currently in the
  process of being standardized with Anderson Power Pole connectors. A
  [RIGrunner 4012](https://powerwerx.com/west-mountain-radio-rigrunner-4012)
  will be placed below the desk, against the wall, and custom-length cables will
  supply each radio. The goal is to have easily maintainable and unobtrusive
  wiring.

* **Computer** - The primary shack computer is a custom desktop build, several
  years old. It's running an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 with 48GB of RAM. I run Gentoo
  Linux with a custom kernel configuration. Other computers nearby include a
  Macbook Air (M1 chip), Pinebook Pro, Intel Mac Mini, and a few ThinkPads. (For
  bragging rights, I also have an IBM 755C ThinkPad which has a 486 processor in
  it, and a Tadpole SPARC laptop).

* **HF/6m** - Until recently, this was done with an IC-706mkii. However, it was
  recently replaced with an IC-7300. The IC-7300 feeds to a Daiwa CN-801
  power/SWR meter, when then feeds to a JPS ANC-4 noise canceller device, which
  then feeds to the loop controller for the MFJ magnetic loop. The loop
  controller is left in-line constantly, as it seems to be passive if
  connected to a different antenna, so long as the tuning buttons aren't
  pressed. The loop controller output then runs along my apartment's main
  hallway eventually into the Comet CTC-50 which feeds through the door to the
  balcony.

* **2m/70cm** - This is currently provided by a Kenwood TM-V71a, which connects
  to the Diamond vertical on the front balcony.

* **33cm** - 900MHz is provided by a Kenwood TK-941, which has some of the
  quietest, best sounding receive audio I've ever heard. Additionally, I have a
  TK-481 HT, and a Motorola MCS2000 model 1. One of these radios (likely the
  TK-941) will soon become the first AI5A AllStarLink simplex node.
