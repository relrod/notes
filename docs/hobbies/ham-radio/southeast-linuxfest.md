# Southeast Linuxfest (SELF)

Welcome and thanks for your interest in **W4L**, the special event callsign for
the [Southeast Linuxfest](https://southeastlinuxfest.org/).

Southeast Linuxfest is an annual community event/conference, for those who wish
to learn more about Linux and open source software and hardware. More
information about the event can be found on the
[About](https://southeastlinuxfest.org/?page_id=774) page of the event's
website.

Ham radio and open source go hand-in-hand and fit together very well. Both are
perfect for tinkerers who like to know how things work.

# W4L

To help advocate and advance the relationship between open source and amateur
radio, each year Southeast Linuxfest runs a special event station, W4L.

Our goals are twofold:

1. To spread awareness of open source in the amateur radio community.
2. To spread awareness of amateur radio in the open source community.
