You can sometimes find me on local repeaters if you're in the area, or on HF (lately, FT8). Feel free to email me at: me@[my callsign].me and I'll respond as able. 73! The N8SQL Antenna Farm Due to living in an apartment, I operate with some compromise antennas. I have a Comet CTC-50 window feed-thru jumper to run connections in through the sliding balcony door. Switching antennas is currently a manual process - going out on the balcony and connecting the antenna for the band I want to operate. I plan to fix this in the future with a remote antenna switch, but it's not a huge priority. My view of the world mostly runs NE and SW, at least from the back balcony. NW is blocked by an adjacent apartment building directly across from my balcony, and SE is blocked by my own apartment building, although I have a front balcony and could (and might in the future) put something directional out there. Currently all of my antennas are on the back balcony. My current setup is as follows (from low to high frequency): 40m - For 40m, I have a custom-made dipole that is zip-tied to the railing posts of my balcony, in a square-wave pattern. That is, the antenna goes up one post, over, down the next, over, up the next, etc. This covers most of the length of the antenna, but there is some wire left on both sides, which currently just rests on the balcony floor. The antenna terminates to a homebrew 1:1 balun. This setup works \"okay\" and the SWR is locked down, but the antenna is unfortunately not very efficient. It can get me on 40m in a pinch, but I think the square-wave pattern limits the effectiveness of the antenna. 10m - 30m - For the higher HF bands up through 10m, I use an MFJ-1782 mag loop. Although mag loops are typically considered compromise antennas, I've actually been very happy with the results. I obtained WAS and CQ WPX with the antenna and work DX regularly on FT8 with no issues. The Comet jumper mentioned above functions just fine with the loop controller. The antenna is mounted on a Wiregard DS-2000 22\" mast, which itself is mounted to the top of my balcony railing with two large C-clamps, to avoid drilling into the wood of the balcony. (The antenna is also rope-tied to the balcony as a safe-guard in case the C-clamps fail for any reason). 6m (dipole) - I have two antennas for 6m, the first is a small wire dipole which rests along the top of my balcony railing and terminates to a balun. 6m (stressed moxon) (NOTE: I ordered this but don't actually have it in hand yet) The second, and newer, antenna I have for 6m is a stressed moxon (SM-50) from PAR Electronics. This antenna is mounted above the 10m - 30m mag loop, on the same Wiregard mast. 2m/70cm (vertical) - This is provided by a Diamond X30A vertical which lives on the back balcony with the other antennas. It might some day move to the front balcony, to offer some separation from the HF antennas, as the two can interfere (talking on HF causes noise on 2m, for example). I also have a DPD Productions 2 meter blade antenna which lives indoors but rarely sees any use. 2m (horizontal) - Additionally, I have a GRA-YG1443 2m/70cm square dipole, but it is not currently in use. 33cm - For 900MHz, I have a small magmount which is currently indoors and works well enough to hit the two distinct 900MHz repeater systems in the area (K5TRA and KA5D). The N8SQL Shack Audio - This is currently a work in progress, but the plan is to use a Soundcraft Ui12 digital mixer that I had laying around. All of the radios will feed into it, and it will be controllable via any device on the network (such as my desktop, or a tablet on the desk showing the mixer console for quick access). HF/6m - Until recently, this was done with an IC-706mkii. However, it was recently replaced with an IC-7300. The IC-7300 feeds to a Daiwa CN-801 power/SWR meter, when then feeds to the loop controller for the MFJ mag loop. The loop controller is left in-line constantly, as it seems to be passive if connected to a different antenna, so long as the tuning buttons aren't pressed. The loop controller output then runs along my apartment's main hallway (using Legrand Wiremold covers to hide them) into the Comet CTC-50 which feeds through the door to the balcony. All patch cables (radio-meter, meter-controller) are RG400. They are wrapped around #31 ferrite cores as are most of the other cables and wires that are anywhere near the radios. 2m/70cm - This is currently provided by a Kenwood TM-V71a. It works fairly well, but my setup has a bit of a \"hiss\" on some of the repeaters in the area, that I wish it didn't. Moving the antenna to the other balcony might fix this. 33cm - 900MHz is provided by a Kenwood TK-941, which has some of the quietest, best sounding receive audio I've ever heard.","title":"Ham Radio (N8SQL)"},{"location":"hobbies/ham-radio/#ham-radio-n8sql","text":"I operate out of Austin, TX, typically on 40m up through 33cm (excluding 1.25m, currently).
