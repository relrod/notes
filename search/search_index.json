You can sometimes find me on local repeaters if you're in the area (usually on \"The OAK\" 147.320, on the K5TRA 900MHz system, or on the KA5D system) or on HF (lately, FT8 and often on 6m when it is open). The AI5A Antenna Farm Due to living in an apartment, I operate with some compromise antennas. The good news is that I have two balconies to work with and that apartment management seems to not be super scared of antennas. As a result, I don't have to be super stealth. However, I also try to keep things toned down so as not to poke the bear. I have Comet CTC-50 window feed-thru jumpers to run connections in through the sliding balcony doors. Switching antennas for HF is currently a manual process - going out on the balcony and connecting the antenna for the band I want to operate. I plan to fix this in the future with a remote antenna switch, but it's not a huge priority, just a minor inconvenience. Currently, most of HF (10-30m) is provided by one antenna, anyway. Switching is only required when going from 40m, 10-30m, and 6m. My view of the world mostly runs NE and SW. NW is blocked by an adjacent apartment building directly across from my back balcony. A view of the SE is accessible from the front balcony, though I don't currently take advantage of it. In the future, I might put something directional there to target SA contacts, if I can find something small enough. Currently, all of my HF antennas are on the back balcony, and most of my VHF/UHF antennas are on the front balcony. The exceptions are a KP-20 900MHz antenna that is hidden in the closet of my back balcony (it's an 8ft tall antenna!), and a 2m j-pole which I can switch to in order to hear some of the locals on simplex night better. Diagram of antennas on the back balcony. My current setup is as follows (from low to high frequency): 40m - For 40m, I have a custom-made dipole that is zip-tied to the railing posts of my balcony, in a square-wave pattern. That is, the antenna goes up one post, over, down the next, over, up the next, etc. This covers most of the length of the antenna, but there is some wire left on both sides, which currently just rests on the balcony floor. The antenna terminates to a homebrew 1:1 balun. This setup works \"okay\" and the SWR is locked down, but the antenna is unfortunately not very efficient. It can get me on 40m in a pinch, but I think the square-wave pattern limits the effectiveness of the antenna. 10m - 30m - For the higher HF bands up through 10m, I use an MFJ-1782 magnetic loop, positioned horizontally. Although magnetic loops are typically considered compromise antennas, I've actually been very happy with the results. I obtained WAS and CQ WPX with the antenna and work DX regularly on FT8 with no issues. The Comet jumper mentioned above functions just fine with the loop controller. The antenna is mounted on a Wiregard DS-2000 22\" mast, which itself is mounted to the top of my balcony railing with two large C-clamps, to avoid drilling into the wood of the balcony. (The antenna is also rope-tied to the balcony as a safe-guard in case the C-clamps fail for any reason). 6m (dipole) - I have two antennas for 6m, the first is a small wire dipole which rests along the top of my balcony railing and terminates to a balun. 6m (stressed moxon) The second, and newer, antenna I have for 6m is a stressed moxon (SM-50) from PAR Electronics. This is not currently in use yet, but will eventually be on the back balcony and be stationary, pointed toward the NE. 2m/70cm (vertical) - This is provided by a Diamond X30A vertical which lives on the front balcony, currently by itself. 2m (j-pole) I also have a DPD Productions 2 meter blade antenna which lives on the back balcony. I can switch between the Diamond and this one, depending on need. Usually the j-pole on the back balcony works better for hearing some of the locals on the Tuesday night simplex net. 2m (horizontal) - Additionally, I have a GRA-YG1443 2m/70cm square dipole, but it is not currently in use. 33cm (whip) - For 900MHz, I have a small Laird QW8963 whip atop a Laird MBC800 counterpoise base. It is currently on the back balcony and on the same mast as the HF magnetic loop. This whip is being replaced by: 33cm (vertical) - I also now have a Comet KP-20 vertical. Because the antenna is so tall (8ft), it lives its life hidden away in the closet on my back balcony. Using this, I can often be found on the 927-Tech system. The AI5A Shack Desk Shelving - All radio gear is housed on a PENGKE shelf unit bought on Amazon. The shelf assembles into two pieces which fit together and slide to change the width of two of the shelves. On the top shelf is my audio mixer (discussed below). Below that are my VHF/UHF and 900MHz radios. Below that (on the desk, but still enclosed within the shelf unit) is a Daiwa power/SWR meter. To the right is a shelf which houses the ANC-4 noise canceller (discussed below) and MFJ loop controller. And finally, below that is the IC-7300. Wiring is currently a bit of a work in progress, but a picture of the shelf unit will be posted in the near future. Audio - All radios along with computer audio go through a Soundcraft Ui12 digital audio mixer. Primary output is headphones currently. Levels can be controlled via any device on the network (i.e., tablet, phone, or desktop). Cables - All patch cables (radio-meter, meter-controller) are RG400. They are wrapped around #31 ferrite cores as are most of the other cables and wires that are anywhere near the radios. Coax runs throughout the apartment are mostly RG-8X, with a planned upgrade to LMR-400 spec for 900MHz. They are hidden with cable covers such as Legrand Wiremold covers . Power - Power is provided by an Astron RS-35A and is currently in the process of being standardized with Anderson Power Pole connectors. A RIGrunner 4012 will be placed below the desk, against the wall, and custom-length cables will supply each radio. The goal is to have easily maintainable and unobtrusive wiring. Computer - The primary shack computer is a custom desktop build, several years old. It's running an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 with 48GB of RAM. I run Gentoo Linux with a custom kernel configuration. Other computers nearby include a Macbook Air (M1 chip), Pinebook Pro, Intel Mac Mini, and a few ThinkPads. (For bragging rights, I also have an IBM 755C ThinkPad which has a 486 processor in it, and a Tadpole SPARC laptop). HF/6m - Until recently, this was done with an IC-706mkii. However, it was recently replaced with an IC-7300. The IC-7300 feeds to a Daiwa CN-801 power/SWR meter, when then feeds to a JPS ANC-4 noise canceller device, which then feeds to the loop controller for the MFJ magnetic loop. The loop controller is left in-line constantly, as it seems to be passive if connected to a different antenna, so long as the tuning buttons aren't pressed. The loop controller output then runs along my apartment's main hallway eventually into the Comet CTC-50 which feeds through the door to the balcony. 2m/70cm - This is currently provided by a Kenwood TM-V71a, which connects to the Diamond vertical on the front balcony. 33cm - 900MHz is provided by a Kenwood TK-941, which has some of the quietest, best sounding receive audio I've ever heard. Additionally, I have a TK-481 HT, and a Motorola MCS2000 model 1. One of these radios (likely the TK-941) will soon become the first AI5A AllStarLink simplex node.","title":"Ham Radio (AI5A)"},{"location":"hobbies/ham-radio/#ham-radio-ai5a","text":"I operate out of Austin, TX, typically on 40m up through 33cm (excluding 1.25m, currently).

The Idea The idea went through several iterations and started with Kyle/KA5D suggesting that somebody bring a portable repeater to the hamfest. Having been getting into AllStarlink, I offered to work on it, if someone could provide the duplexer for it. Shortly after, Sean/W5SMS proposed that a simplex node would probably suffice, with the goal of linking it back to the N5OAK repeater network , and allowing it to be used, in particular, for the Friday night trivia net . This idea appealed to me. I already set up one simplex node (the 900MHz node at my apartment), and it went well. I already had plans to set up more and turn them into repeaters. So this seemed like a good project. So I volunteered. I took the project and ran with it. The Construction I had a few things at my disposal already: A radio (Motorola PM400) that I wasn't using for anything and which had a port on the back that would work fine for interfacing. Interface boards (ordered from Techno By George, LLC ) for experimenting. Two metal 10 1/4\" x 9 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" enclosures, one of which I was willing to dedicate to the project. Familiarity with the configuration and administration of AllStarLink from my previous node. That meant I needed, at minimum: A computer to dedicate to it - originally I considered using a laptop, but I wanted something that would fit in the enclosure, so I with with a Raspberry Pi (3B+) instead. A solution for power, including powering the Pi. A solution for heat. A solution for RF (antenna connection). A solution for getting the thing online, not knowing how WiFi would be at the hamfest. I ordered the Raspberry Pi from Vilros. It got delayed (USPS) but ended up showing up on time anyway. Phew. For power, I realized that the radio (even on high power, which I'm not planning to use) only drew 9A according to the specification sheet. The Pi won't draw too much because it's not going to be under much load. And the fans will hardly draw anything at all. So, I decided to get a 12.5A switching power supply from Amazon, snip the end off, and terminate it with an Anderson Power Pole connector. The power problem was mostly solved. I still needed a way to power the Pi, so I bought a USBbuddy from Powerwerx, along with a PD-4 to distribute power to the various devices. I ran a short Power Pole pigtail out of the enclosure through one of the punch-outs and into the PD-4, and lo and behold, I had power. The power supply is kept outside of the enclosure (and is optional - if 12vdc power exists nearby, it can be used instead directly into the enclosure, otherwise the switching supply can be used from 110vac). The problem of heat is something a bit harder to deal with and that I am still keeping an eye on. The radio I'm using (PM400) has its heat sink on the bottom, not on the back. So it is hard to cool with a fan. In any case, I bought a few Noctua fans having had good luck with them in the past. They're nice and quiet. I have one blowing toward the back of the radio, and one blowing out the side of the enclosure (blowing out another punch-out hole). So far, nothing has overheated to the point of failing. Attaching an antenna to the node is done by way of a panel mount SO239 coupler , whose connector goes through one of the punch-outs in the enclosure, and whose base is screwed into the enclosure with two small drill holes and screws. The radio expects a Mini UHF connector, and the easiest (and shortest) way to get there was PL259 to SMA , then SMA to Mini UHF . There might be a better way, but this seemed to work well enough and let me use a small (6\") jumper easily (the PL259 to SMA). Getting the thing online was another challenge, and took some research for the cheapest, no-contract 4G option I could find. I ended up going with Straight Talk's prepaid hotspot plan . They offered a refurbished hotspot device for free when you first sign up, so for $15, I was set with 2GB of 4G data. This is not a promotional post for Straight Talk, and I have no idea how well it will do, but it's what I went with. Getting everything mounted in the case was a bit of a Tetris-like puzzle, but with some diligence, I was able to make things fit. Things are mounted in with 3M Command Strips, which in theory should be strong enough to hold things up with the enclosure being vertical or horizontal. In my testing, I've kept it horizontal. The Pi was configured using Ansible. I will be publishing my AllStarLink Ansible configuration in the near future as open source. This made it trivial to get the node up and working, I had to do very little configuration myself. (I later went back and tweaked things to make it slightly nicer to use, like shorter tails and courtesy tones, and some custom scripting to make it announce the PL occasionally (as a reminder to people who don't have it set). Some later additions included a status script that I wrote which will make it ping the 4G hotspot to request service level and battery level and say them over the air. A temperature sensor was added under the radio to report the heat sink temperature along with the Pi CPU temperature at the touch of a DTMF code. I also subscribed to tailscale VPN and joined the Pi to the hosted VPN, to give myself a way to backdoor into it if needed. I can connect to it and SSH into it from any other device on the VPN such as a phone or laptop. So far it's worked well, and I've been really happy with the service in my few days of testing. Another late addition was that of a DTMF matrix keypad and some custom code to take input from it and sent it allong to AllStarLink/asterisk. Final-ish Product Minor tweaks have taken place since this shot was taken, but it shows the mostly finished product. Future Plans The wiring needs to be a bit cleaner - mostly by making the wires be shorter than they are instead of coiling them up. This is a future enhancement. Working out a better solution to the heating problem is another enhancement, but will require much experimentation. The heat sink being on the bottom of the radio makes it a hard problem to solve. More fancy scripting ideas. Anything goes here - stuff useful to portable operations.

Attaching an antenna to the node is done by way of a panel mount SO239 coupler , whose connector goes through one of the punch-outs in the enclosure, and whose base is screwed into the enclosure with two small drill holes and screws. The radio expects a Mini UHF connector, and the easiest (and shortest) way to get there was PL259 to SMA , then SMA to Mini UHF . There might be a better way, but this seemed to work well enough and let me use a small (6\") jumper easily (the PL259 to SMA). Getting the thing online was another challenge, and took some research for the cheapest, no-contract 4G option I could find. I ended up going with Straight Talk's prepaid hotspot plan . They offered a refurbished hotspot device for free when you first sign up, so for $15, I was set with 2GB of 4G data. This is not a promotional post for Straight Talk, and I have no idea how well it will do, but it's what I went with. Getting everything mounted in the case was a bit of a Tetris-like puzzle, but with some diligence, I was able to make things fit. Things are mounted in with 3M Command Strips, which in theory should be strong enough to hold things up with the enclosure being vertical or horizontal. In my testing, I've kept it horizontal. The Pi was configured using Ansible. I will be publishing my AllStarLink Ansible configuration in the near future as open source. This made it trivial to get the node up and working, I had to do very little configuration myself. (I later went back and tweaked things to make it slightly nicer to use, like shorter tails and courtesy tones, and some custom scripting to make it announce the PL occasionally (as a reminder to people who don't have it set). Some later additions included a status script that I wrote which will make it ping the 4G hotspot to request service level and battery level and say them over the air. A temperature sensor was added under the radio to report the heat sink temperature along with the Pi CPU temperature at the touch of a DTMF code. I also subscribed to tailscale VPN and joined the Pi to the hosted VPN, to give myself a way to backdoor into it if needed. I can connect to it and SSH into it from any other device on the VPN such as a phone or laptop. So far it's worked well, and I've been really happy with the service in my few days of testing. Another late addition was that of a DTMF matrix keypad and some custom code to take input from it and sent it allong to AllStarLink/asterisk.","title":"The Construction"},{"location":"hobbies/ham-radio/portable-node/#final-ish-product","text":"Minor tweaks have taken place since this shot was taken, but it shows the mostly finished product.","title":"Final-ish Product"},{"location":"hobbies/ham-radio/portable-node/#future-plans","text":"The wiring needs to be a bit cleaner - mostly by making the wires be shorter than they are instead of coiling them up. This is a future enhancement. Working out a better solution to the heating problem is another enhancement, but will require much experimentation. The heat sink being on the bottom of the radio makes it a hard problem to solve. More fancy scripting ideas. Anything goes here - stuff useful to portable operations.

The goal of the system for now is coverage for the South Central Austin area (Galindo, Dawson, Zilker, Bouldin Creek, South Lamar, SoCo, etc.). The system is planned to extend to become a 900MHz repeater alongside a UHF simplex node in the future, and possibly with more remote repeaters in the future. The system is open for all to use! Affiliations and Links The system links up to some other local repeater systems for weekly nets. The 900MHz system (currently the only piece of the system) also links to the 927-Tech/K5TRA system every evening at 21:30 except when a net conflicts per below. The system is currently set up with the following schedule: Day Time Link Comments W 19:55 - 21:15 KA5D System UT ARC weekly net Th 19:55 - 23:00 N5OAK System Oak Hill ARC weekly net F 20:45 - 00:00 N5OAK System Oak Hill ARC weekly trivia net Su, M, Tu, W, Sa 21:30 - ?? 927-Tech/K5TRA (900 only) Nightly roundtable Software Configuration The system is using AllStarLink as a controller. The AllStarLink configuration is templated extensively with the use of Ansible. I plan to open-source the Ansible roles and configuration in the very near future. Adding a new node to the system with a configuration that is the same as the other nodes is as simple as editing one file to add one dictionary to an array. The Pi controlling the system is a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspberry Pi OS. 900MHz (927.9750 MHz) The 900MHz node is available on 927.9750 MHz with a tone of 151.4 Hz . It outputs around 15 watts into a Comet KP-20 on a second-story balcony. The eventual plan is to turn it into a low-power repeater. The node is currently provided by a TK-941, connected to a K5TRA interface board, which then connects via USB to the Pi mentioned above. NOTE: (Currently not relevant, but will be once there is more than one node): The 900MHz node delinks from the rest of the system most evenings, per the schedule above, and links into the 927-Tech system. This system is intended to be 900MHz and higher only, so in the interest of keeping true to that, only the 900MHz node links to it, dropping from the rest of the system. The pictures below show the layout of the node, which currently sits on a rack-mountable shelf. It is designed to fit in a 1U enclosure, but I have not yet acquired one. Due to the slight slant of the rack , everything is stuck to the shelf with 3M Command Strips to prevent it from sliding back.
